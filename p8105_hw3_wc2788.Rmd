```

## Problem 1

load the data from  p8105.datasets
```{r} 
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```
This dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` rows and `r ncol(instacart)` columns, where each row in the dataset is a product from an order.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% #count how many aisles
  arrange(desc(n)) #find the most items ordered
```
There are 134 aisles, and fresh vegetables are most ordered.
